# The-Nuse-Orbital
Hi, Welcome to The Nuse, a project by Alexis and Ser Wei !

## Proposed level of achievement: Gemini

## Porblem motivation:
Over two-thirds of adults get their news from social media, particularly Facebook and Twitter. Yet, unreliability in these social media platforms has not deterred users from continuously using these platforms due to the convenience it provides. We hope that through The Nuse, we will provide reliable news from big news websites, such as The Guardian and BBC, that is also convenient to users.

## Project scope:
The Nuse gathers the daily news from subscribed news channels and brings it together for the users in a drop down chrome extension.
 
As a chrome extension, it provides the user with personalised news articles any time of the day. Users subscribe to news channels through The Nuse and The Nuse will pull news from these news channels directly to users. Moreover, it includes social media integration where users can choose to share the article through Facebook or Twitter. The Nuse also allows users to save the articles into a folder to read at a later time. The Nuse has a citation creator for research students to easily cite these articles in their papers.

## Development plan:
1st week June: Create basic chrome extension with ability to pull news from website
2nd week June: Form skeleton of chrome extension (looks)
3rd week June: Add additional features (social media integration, save news articles, citation creator)
4th week June: First prototype finished
1st week July: Implementation of peer teamâ€™s suggestions
2nd week July: Add any additional features required
3rd week July: Testing and debugging 
4th week July: Finalise product
